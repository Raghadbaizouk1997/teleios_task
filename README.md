i am using React library with tailwind for styling (this is first time i am using tailwind, I had more possibilities through CSS)

to run project by using in terminal (on vscode):
npm install
npm start

For submit Form i am using api to save data  app.getform.io
you can login by:
UserName: teleiosform9
Email:teleiosform9@gmail.com
Password: teleiosform9admin

As for the content on the site, it is not compatible with your site or as a design with the other site
I worked on designing something somewhat new, and ideas are subject to change. I just wanted to present an idea about my work

I used the same video in the other link because your main site does not contain a video and it represents an essential visual element.

I could add a lot of animation , but time did not allow me
I worked an average of only three or four hours a day on this project Because I am tied to another job.

There was potential to generalize reusable components further And in dealing with errors and validation on form.

Files should be given more clear names

For structure:
in App i am callind all component:
GradientBtn: general Component for all bottom in page
Navbar: for header (i pass data as json .. we can using data.json file and import it inside Navber and for all project) with submenu for each one(domy data)
HeroSection: For Section with video
VirtualGP: for video section (you can press in outside screen to close video) with text(the content not agree with images)
Gallery: it content title with ImageSlider for swiper for group of images(in first i was using swiper its ready package to make slider but then i made it fro scratch for 5 images just we can using more)
SocialGame/Booking : for section title with description and TilteCard (global for image with motion)
Customer: (for section with title customer)
Contact: there is PageSection(general component for padding items in page with title and description and button) 
with ContentForm Component(this with form, validation, axios for saving data ) and when save form it show sweetalert  then
hidden all ContentComponent and show thanks message
Social: for social media
Footer: can be better than now.
